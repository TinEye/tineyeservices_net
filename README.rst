DEPRECATED
==========

The `TinEye Services <https://services.tineye.com/>`_ libraries will not be maintained in the future.
The current recommended best practice is to access the APIs using an HTTP
library native to the language of your choice.
The `TinEye Developer Documentation <https://services.tineye.com/developers/>`_ 
includes interactive code examples for all API calls to help you get started.

C# library for TinEye Services
==============================

**TinEyeServices** is a C# library for the MatchEngine, MobileEngine,
MulticolorEngine and WineEngine APIs. MatchEngine, MobileEngine, MulticolorEngine
and WineEngine are general image matching engines that allow you to perform large
scale image comparisons for a variety of tasks.
See `<https://services.tineye.com/>`_ for more information.

Dependencies
============

The project makes use of the following libraries:

log4net for logging - http://logging.apache.org/log4net/

newtonsoft Json.Net for parsing and handling JSON objects - http://json.codeplex.com/
